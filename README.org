* Image generator for yr.no weather reports
** Introduction

This is a CGI script that takes a pathinfo argument that is the local part of an [[http://www.yr.no/verdata/1.5543273][yr.no embeddable javascript,]] with the exclusion of the ".js" extension, and renders the javascript as a PNG file, and then returns the rendered javascript as a PNG image.

** Usage example

For a script like
#+begin_src html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="www.yr.no/sted/Norge/Akershus/Bærum/Skui/ekstern_boks_stripe.js">
#+end_src
create an <img> reference like this:
#+begin_src html
  <img href="http://mysite.com/cgi-bin/yr-as-image/sted/Norge/Akershus/Bærum/Skui/ekstern_boks_stripe" alt="" />
#+end_src

** Requirements
The CGI script is intended to run with an [[http://httpd.apache.org/][apache httpd]] (it will run on any HTTP server supporting CGI scripts) on a unix-ish system (*BSD, GNU/linux, or even an old-fashioned linux if they still exist), and the requirements are:
 - [[https://www.perl.org/][perl]]
 - [[http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/][CutyCapt]] a program that can render an HTML page as an image
 - [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb][Xvfb]] to be able to run CutyCapt headless
 - [[http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/][netpbm]] (to crop the image rendered by CutyCapt)

** Installation

Instructions:
 - [[https://github.com/steinarb/yr-cgi/raw/master/yr-as-image][Download the yr-as-image script]] and save it into the cgi-bin directory
 - Make the yr-as-image script executable:
   : chmod +x yr-as-image

On a debian or debian-ish (i.e. Ubuntu, mint, skolelinux) system, the dependencies can be added with the command:
: sudo apt-get install apache2 perl cutycapt xvfb netpbm

** Known issues

The [[https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/cutycapt][CutyCapt version of debian stable]] creates a background colour that pnmcrop isn't able to crop away.  However, [[https://packages.debian.org/jessie/cutycapt][the CutyCapt version of debian testing]] creates images with a croppable background colour, so hopefully this will right itself in time.
